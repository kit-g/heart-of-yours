Translate the "en" column value to Russian and put it in the "ru" column.

Rules:

- Keep the same tone and style (casual, friendly, with emojis where present)
- Preserve all placeholders like {exerciseName}, {count}, {date}, etc. exactly as-is
- Preserve ICU plural syntax like {howMany,plural, =1{...}other{...}} — only translate the text inside
- Keep technical terms or translate them naturally for Russian fitness context
- Match the character length roughly for UI labels
- Preserve line breaks
